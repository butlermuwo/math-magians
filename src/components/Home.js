          Mathematics is a fundamental part of human thought and logic,
          and integral to attempts at understanding the world and ourselves.
          Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline
          and encourages logical reasoning and mental rigor. In addition,
          mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the
          contents of other school subjects such as science, social studies,
          and even music and art.

          Secondly, since mathematics provides foundational knowledge
          and skills for other school subjects, such as sciences, art,
          economy, etc., the issue of how mathematics is intertwined with
          other school subjects deserved to be addressed. In some curricula,
          mathematics is offered independently to support the study of other
          school subjects as an ‘instrumental subject’, and in other curricula,
          integrated courses which combine mathematics and other fields are offered.
